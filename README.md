I really enjoyed working on this task.<br />
During my work I have encountered new challenges and gained new skills.<br />
I learned a lot about the different ways of communicating with the Terminal and executing bash command <br />
through the python enviroment - the usage of subproccess especially.<br />
I learned about the ways I can grab the different outcomes of the commands and use it.<br />
In addition I encountered new commands that wasn't familiar to me like 'strace' and 'tcpdump'.<br />

I especially enjoyed the opportunity of dilling with an unfamiliar subject and try solving it on my own, while <br />searching different resources for answers.
